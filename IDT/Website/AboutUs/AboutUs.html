We work on two tracks: 
The first one is developing the engineer by giving him technical & non-technical sessions and trainings which prepare him to be able to join the labor market.
The second track is developing the factory by solving the industrial problems in our national or multinational factories such as Bticino, ABB,and Nissan. ">
